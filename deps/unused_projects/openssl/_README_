This folder should contain unpacked openSSL project:

https://www.openssl.org/source/

Folders include, ssl, util should go directly at this level!

HOW TO BUILD OpenSSL:
http://p-nand-q.com/programming/windows/building_openssl_with_visual_studio_2013.html

You need to install Perl. I used ActivePerl 5.16.3 for Windows (x86):
http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/thank-you?dl=http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.20.2.2001/ActivePerl-5.20.2.2001-MSWin32-x64-298913.msi

Building the 32-bit version

    Open CMD.EXE in the directory C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin
    Run vcvars32.bat
    Change to the source directory, for example C:\openssl-src-32
    Run perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=C:\Build-OpenSSL-VC-32. This will make C:\Build-OpenSSL-VC-32 your output directory; it should be fairly obvious how you can change that.
    Run ms\do_ms
    Run nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
    Run nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install
    Optional: I copy the PDB files from C:\openssl-src-32\out32dll to the output folder C:\Build-OpenSSL-VC-32, but that may be just me.

    Note: you can stop reading here if you only need the release build. The next few steps show you how to build the debug binaries as well.

    Run perl Configure debug-VC-WIN32 --prefix=C:\Build-OpenSSL-VC-32-dbg
    Run ms\do_ms
    Run nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
    Run nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install
    Optional: I copy the PDB files from C:\openssl-src-32\out32dll.dbg to the output folder C:\Build-OpenSSL-VC-32-dbg, but that may be just me.
